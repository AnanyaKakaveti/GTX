Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
With you I celebrate and suffer everything
And my joys and my evils
le ro lo le lo le Le ro lo le lo le
you know that 'm at your feet
With you my life
I want to live my life
y lo que me queda de vida
I want to live with you
with you my life
I want to live my life
and with what's left of my life
I want to spend with you
It's lucky to have sincere lips
to kiss you more eagerly
Lucky that my ******* are small and humble
So you don't confuse 'em with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that tell me
to cry when you leave
le ro lo le lo le Le ro lo le lo le
You know I'm at your feet
With you my life
I want to live my life
And with what's left of my life
I want to spend with you
With you my life
I want to spend my life
And with what's left of my life
I want to spend with you
Le-do-lo-le-lo-le, le-do-lo-le-lo-le
You know I'm at your feet
Le-do-lo-le-lo-le-lo-le
Happiness has your name and skin
With you my life
I want to live my life
And with what's left of my life
I want to spend with you
You know my life I'm up to my neck for you
if you feel something like that I want you to stay with me
With you my life
I want to live my life
And with what's left of my life
I want to spend with you
You know my life I'm up to my neck for you
if you feel something like that I want you to stay with me
